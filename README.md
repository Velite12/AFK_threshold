# AFK Threshold
Notify you either when a certain amount of time has passed or until you become idle, whichever comes last.

The goal of this plugin is to combine the Idle notifier and AFK plugins into one when doing skills which have variable
completion times such as mining and woodcutting. This will allow you to AFK for a certain period of time that you 
specify, but if you happen to not be idle, it will wait until you become idle to let you know. Thus, you can use as much
time as you want to be AFK if you don't actually need to do anything.
